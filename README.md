# Discount Calculator

This repository contains a simple Python program that calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount.

## Problem Description

The program is designed to solve two related problems:

1.  **Function Definition:** Create a function named `calculate_discount` that takes the `price` and `discount_percent` as parameters. This function calculates the final price after a discount, but **only if the discount is 20% or higher**. If the discount is less than 20%, it should return the original price without any change.

2.  **User Interaction:** Use the `calculate_discount` function to prompt a user to enter the original price of an item and the discount percentage. The program will then print the final price after applying the discount (if applicable) or the original price if no discount was applied.
